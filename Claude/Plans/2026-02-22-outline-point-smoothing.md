# Post-Smooth Outline Points for Thin Cross-Stroke Jaggedness

## Problem

Thin cross-strokes appear jagged because the outline points generated by `ItalicOutlineGenerator` oscillate due to hand tremor → direction changes → width fluctuations → perpendicular offset jumps. The Bézier curve smoothing (approach A) didn't help because the outline points themselves are in bumpy positions.

## Fix

After generating the left/right side arrays in `generateItalicOutline()`, apply a moving-average smoothing pass to the coordinates before combining them into the final polygon.

## File Change

### `src/stroke/ItalicOutlineGenerator.ts`

Add a `smoothOutlinePoints()` helper that applies a 3-tap weighted average `[0.25, 0.5, 0.25]` over multiple passes. Apply it to leftSide and rightSide arrays separately (to avoid smoothing across stroke tips). Keep first and last points anchored.

Apply after computing left/right sides (after the main loop) but before combining into the polygon.

3 passes of the kernel gives an effective window of ~7 points, which should smooth out per-point oscillations.

## What Stays the Same

- Width computation, EMA, pressure, taper — all unchanged
- `outlineToPath2D()` — already has Bézier smoothing (additive benefit)
- Stamp rendering — unaffected
- All render sites — unaffected
